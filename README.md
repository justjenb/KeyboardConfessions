# KeyboardConfessions

  > ## DESCRIPTION
As a new developer, building a CMS-style blog site allows me to not only learn about the technical aspects of web development but also understand the significance of effective communication within the developer community.

This project allows me to explore different technologies and frameworks such as Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and express-session, which are widely used in the industry. By following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, I will gain a deeper understanding of architectural structure and maintainability.

Building a blog site from scratch and deploying it to Heroku will provide valuable insights into the entire development lifecycle, from design to deployment. Moreover, enabling features like publishing blog posts and commenting will enhance user interaction and engagement.

Overall, this project allows me to combine technical proficiency with creativity, fostering my growth as a developer and enabling me to make a positive impact within the developer community.
